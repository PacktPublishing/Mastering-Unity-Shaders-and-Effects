# Mastering Unity Shaders and Effects
This is the code repository for [Mastering Unity Shaders and Effects](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-unity-shaders-and-effects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783553679), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions
Understanding key 3D graphics concepts is necessary to complete the chapters in this book. In addition, you will need the following:
- Unity 5 installed on your machine (macOS or Windows). The free personal version of the software is sufficient for all of the project content in this book. This can be downloaded from the Unity webpage.
- A basic understanding of Unity script or C# will be helpful to complete the projects, though the code that is included is clearly explained.

## Note
Since the Unity package file was greater than [100 MB](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/), we have uploaded it using Git LFS. To download the entire code bundle, you can use the command ```git lfs clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/mastering-unity-shaders-and-effects.git``` from Git Shell.
